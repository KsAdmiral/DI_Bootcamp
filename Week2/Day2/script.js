// Exercise 1
// Make a keyless car!

// This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:

// Using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.

// IF they say they are below 18, respond with: "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off
// IF they say they are 18, respond with: "Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!
// IF they say they are over 18, respond with: "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"

let userAge = Number(prompt("What is your age?"));

if (userAge < 18) {
  alert("Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off");
} else if (userAge === 18) {
  alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
} else  {
  alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
}

// Exercise 2
let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    alert( 'Too small' );
    break;
  case 4:
    alert( 'Exactly!' );
    break;
  case 5:
    alert( 'Too large' );
    break;
  default:
    alert( "I don't know such values" );
}
// 4

// Exercise 3
 a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 4:
    alert('Right!');
    break;

  case 3: // (*) grouped two cases
  case 5:
    alert('Wrong!');
    alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
    break;

  default:
    alert('The result is strange. Really.');
